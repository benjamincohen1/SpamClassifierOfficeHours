Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7
