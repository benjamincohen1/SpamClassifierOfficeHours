It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost
is a "minimum $500 per year"... but that only accounts for 18 people
streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage
the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.

The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.
Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title
(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there
are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in
for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get
all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and
nearly impossible...

We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -
which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have
serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people
webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play
on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to
those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it
is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(
