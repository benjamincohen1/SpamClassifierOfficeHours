what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

a.
