I think another venue for finding people is the workplace. As a contractor
I have had the opertunity to meet lots of eligables over the course of my
wandering workhistory.

By starting up your own companies or working in sterile thinklabs you are
cutting yourself off from one heck of a fertile ground for linkages....the

I like the shurch idea as well. Other ideas...

Book circles, geocaching groups, heck Rhorho your still young enough to
