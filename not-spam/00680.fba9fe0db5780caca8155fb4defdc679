SunMSapple meta4 of the day
Im feeling a bit farklempt having spent the night at Todais with the
family so talk amongst yourself..here Ill give you a topic

The current state of IT can be thought of in terms of the Cold war with
the US and the UUSR being MS and Sun/IBM/OSS (does it matter which side
is which?), Apple as Cuba and the US legal system as the UN.

Discuss.
