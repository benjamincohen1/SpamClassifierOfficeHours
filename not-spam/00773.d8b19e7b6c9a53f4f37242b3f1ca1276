Random hack Q: drawing on CDs with lasers?O utensils of the world --

I wonder if it is possible to reverse-engineer the Reed-Solomon 
error-correcting codes to create a bytestream such that, when burned 
onto a CD, you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern?

I suppose this is a modern equivalent to line-printer artwork; I was 
imagining using a CD-RW drive to use the outer track, say, to spell out 
the disc title, creation time, etc. It would sure beat feeding CDs 
through a laser printer :-)
