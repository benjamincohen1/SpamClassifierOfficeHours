How unlucky can you get?So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.

So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I
know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.

Geesh.
