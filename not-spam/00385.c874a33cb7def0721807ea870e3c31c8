Re: Electric car an Edsel...Sunday I drove from Portland down to the Woodburn Dragstrip to check out 
the NEDRA Nationals. <http://www.nedra.com/>

The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I 
ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...

John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 
14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that 
hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year 
topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
12 second run.

John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)

Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
run. Talk about a crotch rocket.
