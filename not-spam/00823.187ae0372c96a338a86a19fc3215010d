The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
of the speakers choice.

Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
pretty weak.
