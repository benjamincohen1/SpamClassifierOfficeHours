Uh, zero.  I'm sort of offended at having to take this question seriously,
like being black and having to actually explain that black people don't
all sing and dance.  I'd guess that gay men compared to straight men have
a linearly greater number of sexual partners on the order of 1.5-2X.  But
then again, it not a monolithic or homogeneous community.  Who knows?

3K is utter shite.
