I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all
these cool features!' isn't always a guarantee of failure - maybe there is a
strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich
application space.

Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into
a link so you don't even have to type anything.

Yes - true true.

What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but
they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc?
example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to
mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.
