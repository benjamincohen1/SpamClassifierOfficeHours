Of course not.  Some people just don't want to be confused by the facts.

But some plonker will come up with yet another computer model
predicting global warming and storms and floods in 50 years even
though it can't predict next week's weather.  And predict widespread
cooling in some parts of the globe (which is now part of global
"warming").  And will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive
scaremong^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H proof.

Umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations, when
even detectable in the noise, go either way depending on which data
you look at.

One study from Vienna showed long-term warming from thermometers at
the airport, and none from other sites.  Another study with data from
Antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being
free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by
the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew
(I may have mentioned this one b4...)
