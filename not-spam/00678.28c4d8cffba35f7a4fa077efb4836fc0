Senate Committee Passes Nanotech BillWeird... I never thought the govmint would get into funding this. You know
'weapons of mass destruction'. etc. etc.

Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill
By Roy Mark

The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to
promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act
would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is
co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).

The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would
support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective
education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers
and professionals.

"The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step
forward for this very small technology," Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to
full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. "Nowhere in the world
are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of
nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to
lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide
the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate
new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will
ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."

The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology
program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also
create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National
Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and
technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.

"My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to
change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer
revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will
mine the opportunities of nanotechnology," Wyden said in introducing the
bill. "At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a
half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various
nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader
in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to
achieving that goal.

To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for
Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to
Nanotechnology would also be established.

According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the
National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the
National Nanotechnology Initiative in June.

Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;
emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and
short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,
equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research
that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting
interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology
transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal
implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,
educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for
measuring progress toward program goals.
