2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: "Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long."
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.
