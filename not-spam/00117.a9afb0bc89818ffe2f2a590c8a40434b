A New Theory on Mapping the New World

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
"America." With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?
