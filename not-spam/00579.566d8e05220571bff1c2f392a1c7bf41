Many of the essays in Oreskes' _Plate
Tectonics_ seem to support this idea:

... and the Navy was in no hurry
to declassify any of these data,
as any uneven coverage could have
revealed the parts of the oceans
they found most interesting.

(What do our seismic networks say
about the middle east?  I hazily
recall a story about LA reporters
asking their local geophysicists
about an early morning quake, to
be told that, as far as could be
figured, the "epicenter" was at a
negative depth, travelling near
mach speed, and presumably headed
towards Edwards)
