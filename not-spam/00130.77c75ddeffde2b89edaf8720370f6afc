Odud writes "RATS, the Rough Auditing Tool for Security, is a security
auditing utility for C, C++, Python, Perl and PHP code. RATS scans source
code, finding potentially dangerous function calls. The goal of this
project is not to definitively find bugs. The current goal is to provide
a reasonable starting point for performing manual security audits.
Produced by [0]Secure Software" Uses a database so you can alter what you
want it to look for. Not a replacement for using stricture or your head
but is a good place to start some security auditing on your Perl.
