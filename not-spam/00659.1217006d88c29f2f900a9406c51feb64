History is written by the victors. If the rabble can put forth there ideas
they will be tempered in the pages of yore as "strong willed voices
decrying the obvious injustices of the day"

Once again, look at the Chicago 7, a loud and rude a crowd of selfish
pricks as you were want to find in the day. History of course colors them
with times great blur filter. The jagged bits that , at the time, were
called rude and obnoxious are now seen as a stab of justive doing in the
sideof the ill pathed goverment.
