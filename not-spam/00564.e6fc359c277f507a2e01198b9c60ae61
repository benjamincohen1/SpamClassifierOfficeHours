TheThresher
Is this old bits? It should be.

I was browsing the local zine store here in Portland OR and found the
second issue of The Thresher...very very sweet. Poltical socio articles on
all manner of things from names you have come to love/despise over the
years. If you have not already, tombobjoewhore says check it out.
