FW: [ILUG] Using Normal IDE Device with a Dell Latitude CPx lapto pI vote usb 1.1 as the chances are the cdr drive is not over 8x write and
thus fireware is of no real use...
but i cant see how you are going to get it working without a cradle. I cant
even get my dell laptop dvd drive to work
as the connectors are not the same as my cd drive ones.. seems dell cant
keep any standards going :-(

I vote external firewire if the laptop has the ports for it.
