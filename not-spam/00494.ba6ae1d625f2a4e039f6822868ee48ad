The Big JumpToday a French officer called Michel Fournier is supposed to get in a
350-metre tall helium balloon, ride it up to the edge of space (40 km
altitude) and jump out.  His fall should last 6.5 minutes and reach
speeds of Mach 1.5.  He hopes to open his parachute manually at the
end, although with an automatic backup if he is 7 seconds from the
ground and still hasn't opened it.
