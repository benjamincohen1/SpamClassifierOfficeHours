Internet saturation (but not in Iceland)Gary's news service at teledyn.com has an article on Internet Saturation.

Let me ask you....If you were on a rock in the middle of the Atlantic, 
mostly in the dark for half the year, wouldn't *you* like a bit of 
internet distraction?   They've already done the obvious and fiber-ringed 
the island.

Latest guestimate stats from Ireland's NUA show a flattening Internet 
population growth. It seems there's two kinds of people, those who will go 
online with the status quo, and those who won't: Canada levels out at 53%, 
the USA at 59% (since 2000!), Denmark flatlines at 60%, Norway at 54%, 
Sweden at 64%, and the UK at 55% ... only Iceland continues unfettered 
beyond 60%. Could this be evidence of a usability barrier? If so, it's a 
clear signal that there's as much fortune to be gained from a 
substantially new Internet interface than all that has been gained so far.
